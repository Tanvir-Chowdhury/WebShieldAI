## üìå Introduction
The rapid growth of the internet and web-based platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for businesses, governments, and individuals. However, this expansion has also brought a sharp increase in cyberattacks such as **SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), DOM manipulation, and website defacement**.  

Traditional security systems like firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) often rely on **signature-based detection**, which is ineffective against evolving and zero-day threats.  

To address this issue, **WebShield AI** is designed as an **AI-powered website intrusion detection and auto-defense system**. Built as a **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** platform, it uses advanced **Machine Learning (ML) models** such as **LSTM for SQL injection detection** and **CNN for website defacement detection**.  

The project integrates:
- **Frontend Dashboard (Vue.js)**
- **Backend API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)**
- **Lightweight JavaScript Agent** deployed on client websites  

It provides **real-time monitoring, threat visualizations, and AI integration**.

## üö® Problem Statement

### Social Problem
Cyberattacks compromise the safety of millions of internet users by stealing sensitive data, defacing websites, and spreading misinformation. For **small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)**, a single security breach can cause:
- Severe financial loss  
- Reputational damage  
- Customer distrust  

Since many SMEs cannot afford enterprise-grade security solutions, they are often left vulnerable.

### Technical Problem
Most traditional website security solutions:  
- Depend on **signature-based rules**, which fail against new/unknown attacks.  
- Lack **adaptive intelligence**, meaning they do not learn or evolve over time.  
- Provide **minimal usability**, requiring experts to manage.  
- Do not offer **centralized SaaS-based dashboards** with AI-driven insights.  

üëâ Thus, there is a pressing need for an **affordable, intelligent, and automated intrusion detection and response system** that can be deployed easily and scale across industries.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Description
**WebShield AI** is an **AI-driven website security platform**. Its goal is to detect modern cyberattacks in real time and notify the website owner.

### üîë Key Features

#### 1. SQL Injection Detection (LSTM Model)
- Trained on SQL queries to differentiate between **malicious and normal queries**.  
- Detects **hidden injection patterns** missed by other security systems.  
- Reports anomalies to the backend and **blocks execution if harmful**.  

#### 2. Website Defacement Detection (CNN Model)
- Uses **visual screenshots** of websites captured periodically.  
- CNN classifies whether the site‚Äôs appearance is **legitimate or tampered**.  

#### 3. DOM Mutation & XSS Detection
- A **lightweight JS agent** monitors DOM changes in real time.  
- Detects malicious `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event injections, etc.  
- Reports anomalies to the backend and **blocks execution if harmful**.  

#### 4. Dashboard (Vue.js Frontend)
- Centralized web portal for users.  
- Features:  
  - Add/manage websites  
  - Toggle protection modules (SQLi, Defacement, XSS, DOM manipulation)  
  - Attack visualizations (charts and logs)  
  - Real-time alerts via email notification  

#### 5. Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- Handles authentication, user sessions, and attack logs.  
- Hosts ML detection APIs.  
- Manages **website-agent communication**.  

#### 6. Auto-Defense Mechanism
- If an attack is detected, the system can:  
  - Mitigate the attack by **redirecting to the Home page**  
  - **Log and notify** the admin in real-time
